            <h3>Part One</h3>
            <p>Naruto's adventure begins with him enrolling at Konoha's Ninja Academy, with the titular character being
                12 years old when he graduates from the academy. He spends the majority of his youth here after being
                abandoned as an orphan, raining under his new adoptive father figure Iruka Umino to become the greatest
                shinobi in the land. After the academy, he joins a squad known as Team 7 with fellow graduates and
                ninjas-in-training Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. The anime follows Naruto's adventures with Team 7
                but
                only one canon year passes in his reality. This sets Narutoas only 13 years old by the time the show
                wraps.

            <h3>Part Two</h3>
            <p>
                The events of Naruto: Shippuden take place two and a half years after the original anime, meaning Naruto
                is 15 years old during the series. Naruto stepped away from the limelight to focus on his training under
                Jiraiya but later returned to Konoha Village at 15 years old. His goofy demeanour has taken a back seat
                for the typical composure of a moody teenager, which kickstarts a dramatic shift in character and tone
                for
                the rest of the series. During the Pain arc, Naruto is explicitly noted to be 16 which adds a very brief
                but vital piece of information when mapping out his age against the timeline of events.
                Naruto: Shippuden takes place over the course of two years which sees the fourth great ninja war or
                fourth shinobi world war take place. Coming out on the other end of two masterpiece arcs, Naruto sits on
                the verge of adulthood at 17 years old.

            <h3>Part Three</h3>
            <p>
                The Last: Naruto the Movie is set just before the finale of Naruto, meaning all the gang are young
                adults by this point. Naruto himself is 19 years old, and the group’s older dynamic allowed the writers
                to focus more on the romantic relationship between Naruto and Hinata. Its in the finale of this film
                where the next blonde-haired troublemaker, Boruto, is born - by the time we see him though, he’s already
                5 years old.

                Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and
                <br> illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
                <br>It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who
                <br>seeks recognition from his peers
                <br>and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his
                <br>village. The story is told in two parts
                <br>– the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and
                the second in his teens.
